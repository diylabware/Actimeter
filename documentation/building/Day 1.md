Day 1
Our participation in this workshop was much anticipated and on the first day we were eager
to be involved in the day's schedule.
After our breakfast we started off with our lectures. With an introduction from Victor and an
introduction to Arduino by Harry.
This led us into practicing simple installations on the arduino uno and the bread board.
It was fun and interesting but since we were yet to apply the knowledge of the use of
resistors we run down our LED bulbs often. Also our laptops were not functioning.
By the end of day one we were familiar with using the arduino uno and the arduino software.
