The day's schedule begun with a presentation by Harry on introduction to basic electronics.
The basics which include resistors, capacitors etc.
This was shortly followed by a presentation on the use of GITHUB-an online platform for
storage and communication of project document.
Our main challenge occurred when we couldn't figure out the right code for the day's
practical work. This was overcome after knust_UHAS team shared the coding.
It was fun soldering our work from the breadboard to perforated board. That was an interesting lesson for the day.
